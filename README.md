# POI Activity Index — DeFi on Flare

**Hackathon submission · Flare-native DeFi with real-world activity attestations**

A DeFi system that ingests open-source geospatial and social data, computes a deterministic activity index off-chain, attests it via **Flare Data Connector (FDC)**, and executes parametric insurance payouts and yield adjustments on-chain. Includes a map-based frontend for POIs (London pubs), activity levels, and wallet flows on **Flare Coston2** testnet.

*For judges: see [Quick start](#quick-start-judge-friendly) below. Our feedback on using Flare protocols is in [Flare protocols — feedback and review](#flare-protocols--feedback-and-review).*

## Quick start (judge-friendly)

1. **Data** — From `data/`: `node jobs/run.js --fetch` (or `node jobs/run.js` to merge only). Output: `storage/pubs_merged.json`.
2. **Contracts** — From `contracts/`: set `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`, then run deploy to Coston2 (see `contracts/README.md`). Copy the logged addresses into `frontend/.env.local` (see `frontend/.env.local.example`).
3. **Frontend** — From `frontend/`: `npm install && npm run dev`. Open http://localhost:3000, connect wallet (Flare Coston2, Chain ID 114), then use **My Wallet**, **Pub Wallet**, and **Activity & Risk** to invest, register pubs, and settle payouts.

**Demo path:** Run data pipeline → deploy contracts to Coston2 → run frontend → connect wallet on Coston2 → invest in a pub → trigger payout in Activity & Risk and settle on-chain.

## Constraints

- **No Google APIs** — OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, Reddit, event APIs only (optional keys).
- **Deterministic, explainable** — No black-box ML; activity index and yield rules are transparent.
- **Flare-native** — FDC for attested Web2 data; Solidity on Flare Coston2; FLR/C2FLR for fees.

---

## Data flow

1. **Data** (`data/`) — Fetches OSM, floor area, employees, ratings, events → merge → activity index (revenue proxy).
2. **FDC** — Activity/index outputs can be attested via Flare Data Connector; contracts consume proofs on-chain.
3. **Contracts** (`contracts/`) — Pool, PubRegistry, SettlementEngine, FTSO oracle.
4. **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — Chain state (wagmi/viem), My Wallet, Pub Wallet, Activity & Risk, settle on-chain.

## Flare protocols — feedback and review

> Flare ended up being a really good fit for this project because we needed a clean way to bring real-world data on-chain without just trusting a single server or oracle. Using **Flare Data Connector (FDC)**, we could take live Web2 JSON data about POI activity and settlement parameters, get it attested, and then verify the proof directly in our smart contracts before triggering payouts.
>
> The hardest part was getting used to the full FDC flow end-to-end — preparing the request, submitting the attestation, waiting for the voting round, fetching the DA proof, and then wiring everything into our Solidity contracts. Debugging across off-chain scripts and on-chain logic took some time, especially when something went wrong in the middle of the pipeline.
>
> Once it was set up though, we had a clear mental model of where the data came from, how it was verified by the network, and how it ended up triggering real financial logic on-chain. That made Flare feel genuinely useful for building DeFi applications that depend on real-world signals like activity levels, usage, or external events, instead of just on-chain data.

## Local setup

- **data/** — Copy `data/.env.example` to `data/.env` if using APIs that need keys.
- **contracts/** — Copy `contracts/.env.example` to `contracts/.env`, set `PRIVATE_KEY`. Use Flare Coston2 RPC.
- **frontend/** — Copy `frontend/.env.local.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and paste the five contract addresses after deploying. Get C2FLR from the [Flare Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).
